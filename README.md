**Course**: Pemrograman Perangkat Lunak Berorientasi Objek

**Assignment**: First Assignment


**Description**:

This repository contains the source code for a basic blog application developed using the Spring framework as part of my first assignment in the "Pemrograman Perangkat Lunak Berorientasi Objek" course. The project demonstrates fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming and Spring development, including:
- **Spring Boot**: Leverages Spring Boot's rapid development features for streamlined configuration and ease of use.
- **Spring Beans**: Manages application components effectively through Spring's dependency injection mechanism.
- **Row Mapper**: Enhances data retrieval flexibility from databases using custom Row Mappers.
- **JPA**: Provides transparent persistence operations with JPA entities and Spring Data JPA.
- **Hibernate**: Utilizes Hibernate as the underlying JPA implementation for robust database interactions.
